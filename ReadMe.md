# Computer Vision (Image Recognition) On MNIST Digit Dataset

# Digit Recognizer

**Data Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data)

**Description:** The [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview) competition is for 
participants to build a supervised learning model that can recognize grayscale images of handwritten numbers ranging from 0 - 9.

**Results:**

- *Model1:* Model1 attained an accuracy of ~99.16% on the test data.

**Possible Area for Improvement:**

To improve my model's performance, I could try a different model architecture.
